Parameter: Temperature
Stage: Retail storage
Question: Temperature* a, b (Average 6hours function) in °C of a single (but not specific) refrigerator (used for prepackaged meat products). 

The reason that we are asking this is to know how fast E. coli may grow during the storage of beef patties in the retail display refrigerators. 
aSince different retail refrigerators have different temperatures, we need to estimate for the various possible temperatures the growth rate of E. coli. If you provide us just one single temperature (of one refrigerator, or the average of 10 refrigerators), we will estimate the growth rate for only this temperature. If you provide us the mathematical distribution that describes the temperatures of (“all”) the retail refrigerators, we will estimate the distribution of a very high number (i.e. 10 7) of growth rates. Given that the “fate” of a single product package is not known, the knowledge of the variability of the retail temperature and the corresponding growth rate is crucial for the risk assessment since we can estimate various combinations through simulation processes. 
The term “all” retail refrigerators is something more than exaggeration. Since we cannot know the temperature of literally all the refrigerators, we need to “sample” a number of retail refrigerators and perform careful extrapolations, for example for various EU countries but not for China, for various size of retail establishments etc.. 
b The reason for asking the average 6 hour temperature for a single refrigerator is to skip the possible variation due to events such holding the door open for quite long, forget the door open, differences during working or not working hours etc.

In any case before posing questions to our platform, we need to feed it with data. 
Expected sources for data about retail refrigerators may be:
1.	Field study. Provide temperature data loggers to retail establishments for monitoring the temperature for a specific time duration. The expected data will be automatically recorded and exported as csv or excel files for 24h (example). These data will be in the following format (Table 1). The analysis of these data can be performed before or after incorporating them in the repository (should be discussed). The analysis may include averaging them appropriately, or approving them or not etc..
Table 1. Temperature evolution over time
Time (h)	Temperature (°C)
0	2,5
0,25	3,388889
0,5	5,388889
0,75	6,5
1	6,777778
1,25	8,5
1,5	8,5

2.	Use already existing data from Ditect partners. Probably the food production companies may have similar data from collaborating retail establishments. The expected format is similar with the one presented in Table 1. The retail establishments may have more detailed automatically recorded data including for example different shelves or points in each display refrigerators. Again, the analysis of these data can be performed before or after incorporating them in the repository (should be discussed). The analysis may include averaging them appropriately, or approving them or not etc..
Additionally, Ditect partners may have already existing data from other projects and wish to share them with us. In this case, the format may be as in Table 1 (“raw data”) or analyzed ones. The analysis may include averaging or may be presented in a form of range or distribution. For the latter case, please see point #3.
3.	Literature or historical data. Literature can provide us with data for temperature. In this case, the expected format will depend on the analysis for the publication. An example for domestic refrigerators in Spain is illustrated (Jofré et al. 2019, https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodres.2019.108578). In this case, different types of data and various expression types can be extracted but, if insisting on the initial question, the answer will be in the form of distribution. Particularly, …“The mean 24 h-temperature profiles (X̅24h) of the surveyed refrigerators followed a normal distribution N(mean = 5.4, SD = 2.3)…”. The analysis of these type of data probably should be performed after being incorporated in the repository (should be discussed).
In any of all these three cases, the desired result is to create a “pool” with temperature values (single values, average 6h) of single refrigerators. Hopefully after this, the aim is to find the overall distribution that describes the retail refrigerators temperature and can be used in the risk assessment through simulation processes. 
Issue to discuss: 
If these data in the platform should be accessible from all the partners for information or dissemination reasons or will be used only from the partners in WP5 or other for analysis. In the first case probably the overall distribution should be (somehow) illustrated in a user friendly way while in the second case the platform can include “raw” but also analyzed data.
