The purpose of this document is to keep track of all concepts that will require mapping to common standards together with brief explanations and links to further resources.

# DiTECT Central Repository
In its initial version the ditect central repository will store two types of data:

- **Traditional Microbiological Data**: Data generated by traditional research to be used as a standard for training and comparison.
- **Rapid Sensor Data**: Output data from various types of rapid sensors determining the metabolic profile of samples. This data will initially be captured manually, but eventually it should be possible to stream the data in real-time.
- **Historical/Aggregate data**: Among other usecases, this data is required for WP5 in order to create *risk assessment models*. This data may come from literature, third party sources or surveys of DiTECT partners. This data is not retrieved automatically. An early example case is the possible temperatures of retail fridges in order to determine growth of e.coli. See [here](https://github.com/MaastrichtU-IDS/ditect-ontology/example-retail-temperature.md).
